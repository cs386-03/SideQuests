# Deliverable 7 - Project Verification and Validation

## 1. Description
SideQuests is an online website allowing users to form a to-do list of tasks they must complete. As users add tasks to the to-do list they get to choose the priority level of their task and the due date of the task. From here a priority 1 task will earn the user 3 points on completion and the priority 3 will net 1 point for the user. The user can collect points and earn trophies to show off how productive they have been in completing tasks.   

From here, the user can go to their profile page to view the rewards they have earned based on the task they completed. These rewards will appear on the user's bookshelf of all the rewards. The goal of this website is to help users say organized and on track to complete all tasks they have in life with a fun twist. Users will have a reward-based system for keeping their life on track. 

## 2. Verification

### 2.1 Unit Test
**Test Framework:** For our unit tests, we used the framework Jest, which can be accessed [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started). \
**Tests Folder:** The folder containing the unit tests can be accessed [here](https://github.com/cs386-03/SideQuests/tree/main/Tests/Unit_Tests). \
**Example:** One example of a unit test containing a mock object is found [here](https://github.com/cs386-03/SideQuests/tree/main/Tests/Unit_Tests/isBirthday.test.js). It creates a mock object of the User class, which contains the user's birthday as an attribute of the user's birthday. It then tests a method that determines whether today is the user's birthday. \

### 2.2 Acceptance Test
**Test Framework:** For our acceptance tests, we used the fromework Selenium WebDriver, which can be accessed [here](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/). \
**Tests Folder:** The folder containing the acceptance tests can be accessed [here](https://github.com/cs386-03/SideQuests/tree/main/Tests/Acceptance_Tests). \
**Example:** One part of the interface that is tested is the ability for users to add items to the to-do list with a title and priority, and then mark them as complete. The user's total points and completed tasks are then displayed. The code for this test can be found [here](https://github.com/cs386-03/SideQuests/tree/main/Tests/Acceptance_Tests/acceptance_test.py). \
**Demo:** A recording of the automated test running can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/cs386-03/SideQuests/tree/main/Demos/acceptance_demo.mp4).

### Reflections
**Lucy:**  
The interview with Lucy made us realize that this website may not work for everyone. Not everyone is motivated through positive reinforcement and it may not click for certain people. She states that it gets the job done, but she was very turned off by the color choices as not much stood out to her visually. With this in mind, the website could probably have a bigger variety in colors in general to better pop out to users or we could implement options to change the colors of the webpage. In addition, she was a bit confused on the buttons and their functionality for the to-do list, being confused on what the complete and delete options for each task, not realizing that the complete button gets rid of the task and adds points. Overall, we could have spent a bit more time deciding design choices and made items a bit more clear on what they do.

**Daniel:**  
The interview with Daniel let us have a lot of insight to the user experience. The rewards system seems to be on the right track when starting out but it seems that there could be more to it. He thinks that the rewards could come from more than just the points and there should be more ways to earn rewards. He also thinks that the color scheme of the website could have more variety. This was a common theme through most of the interviews, so it seems that in the future the website could be updated to have more color options or themes. The website in general serves a good purpose and Daniel can see it being useful for planning out his daily tasks in different areas of life. Overall the functionality of the website seems to be in a good place but the design could be more appealing.

**Logan:**  
The interview with Logan helped us gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of our website. Much of Logan's opinions alligned with the other interviews and helped us realize what we can do to improve. He liked the dark mode scheme of the website, but also agreed that it is a little monotone and could use some variety that is still along the dark mode theme. He thinks the site was easy to use and labeled well. Logan thought that the trophies could also use a little bit more to them. He suggested that the website could show how many points until the next trophy to encourage the user to keep getting points to get closer and closer to the next reward. Overall Logan thought the website's functionality was good but the rewards could be more interconnected to the user experience.


**Summary:**    
With the interviews, we got a lot of insight of what works for the website and what should be improved. Overall, there was a concensus that the website colors were pretty monotone and should have more variety or some brighter colors to pop out to the users. In addition, each user that was interviewed was confused about something about the website, whether it was how the website operated or where to go to perform a certain task. To improve on this, our team could make some items on the website more clear, whether that means making them bigger or brighter or having a short explanation available to new users. As for what we are on the correct track for, the idea of earning rewards does work for users that are motivated by positive reinforcement. To further the idea of rewards and trophies, we could provide a bit more of a visual representation of enticing users to earn more points and when they can get the next reward. This project overall has the basics down for why the website works, but the ability of drawing in users that needs to be worked on. Despite getting a lot of criticism for the website, such as visual appeal, these opinions are very important for pushing the website to the best it can be and it is now more clear of what works for users functionality-wise and what can be refined for the users' taste.
